DHTNet - Lightweight Peer-to-Peer Communication Library

DHTNet is a C++17 library designed to serve as a network overlay that provides an IP network abstraction. Its main objective is to establish secure peer-to-peer connections using public-key authentication.
Dhtnet allows you to connect with a device simply by knowing its public key and efficiently manages peer discovery and connectivity establishment, including NAT traversal.

Features:

- Connection Management:
    DHTNet simplifies the establishment and management of connections to peers, streamlining the communication process.
- Multiplexed Sockets:
    It provides multiplexed sockets that allow multiple channels for data transmission, optimizing network resources.
- UPnP Integration:
    DHTNet seamlessly integrates with UPnP, enabling automatic port mapping and enhanced network connectivity.
- Server TURN Support:
    DHTNet includes support for server TURN, used as a fallback for connections if the NAT block all possible connections.
