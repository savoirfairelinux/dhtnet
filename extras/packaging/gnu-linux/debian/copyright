 @mainpage PJNATH - Open Source ICE, STUN, and TURN Library
 .
 PJNATH (PJSIP NAT Helper) is an open source library providing NAT traversal
 functionalities by using standard based protocols such as STUN, TURN, and ICE.
 .
 Network Address Translation (NAT) is commonly deployed everywhere primarily to
 alleviate the exhaustion of IPv4 address space by allowing multiple hosts to
 share a public/Internet address. While NAT would work well for typical client
 server communications (such as web and email), since it's always the client
 that initiates the conversation and normally client doesn't need to maintain
 the connection for a long time, installation of NAT would cause major problem
 for peer-to-peer communication, such as (and especially) VoIP.

 Comment out all this code if we are using the GNU C Library, and are not
 actually compiling the library itself.  This code is part of the GNU C
 Library, but also included in many other GNU distributions.  Compiling
 and linking in this code is a waste when using the GNU C library
 (especially if it is a shared library).  Rather than having every GNU
 program understand `configure --with-gnu-libc' and omit the object files,
 it is simpler to just do this in the source for each such file.

 FILTERKIT CONTENTS
 .
 LpFilter() - Calculates the filter coeffs for a Kaiser-windowed
 low-pass filter with a given roll-off frequency.  These
 coeffs are stored into a array of doubles.
 .
 writeFilter() - Writes a filter to a file.
 .
 makeFilter() - A section of the original SAIL program.  Calls
 LpFilter() to create a filter, then scales the double
 coeffs into a array of half words.
 .
 readFilter() - Reads a filter from a file.
 .
 FilterUp() - Applies a filter to a given sample when up-converting.
 .
 FilterUD() - Applies a filter to a given sample when up- or down-
 converting.  Both are repoductions of the original SAIL
 program.
 .
 initZerox() - Initialization routine for the zerox() function.  Must
 be called before zerox() is called.  This routine loads
 the correct filter so zerox() can use it.
 .
 zerox() - Given a pointer into a sample, finds a zero-crossing on the
 interval [pointer-1:pointer+2] by iteration.
 .
 Query() - Ask the user for a yes/no question with prompt, default,
 and optional help.
 .
 GetUShort() - Ask the user for a unsigned short with prompt, default,
 and optional help.
 .
 GetDouble() -  Ask the user for a double with prompt, default, and
 optional help.
 .
 GetString() -  Ask the user for a string with prompt, default, and
 optional help.
 .

 PFFFT : a Pretty Fast FFT.
 .
 This is basically an adaptation of the single precision fftpack
 (v4) as found on netlib taking advantage of SIMD instruction found
 on cpus such as intel x86 (SSE1), powerpc (Altivec), and arm (NEON).
 .
 For architectures where no SIMD instruction is available, the code
 falls back to a scalar version.
 .
 Restrictions:
 .
 - 1D transforms only, with 32-bit single precision.
 .
 - supports only transforms for inputs of length N of the form

 An implementation of a 3-band FIR filter-bank with DCT modulation, similar to
 the proposed in "Multirate Signal Processing for Communication Systems" by
 Fredric J Harris.

 The idea is to take a heterodyne system and change the order of the
 components to get something which is efficient to implement digitally.
 .
 It is possible to separate the filter using the noble identity as follows:

 @brief Pseudo-floating point
 * This header file provides a lightweight floating point type for
 * use on fixed-point platforms when a large dynamic range is
 * required. The new type is not compatible with the 32-bit IEEE format,
 * it is not even remotely as accurate as 32-bit floats, and is not
 * even guaranteed to produce even remotely correct results for code
 * other than Speex. It makes all kinds of shortcuts that are acceptable
 * for Speex, but may not be acceptable for your application. You're
 * quite welcome to reuse this code and improve it, but don't assume
 * it works out of the box. Most likely, it doesn't.

 The design goals of this code are:
 - Very fast algorithm
 - SIMD-friendly algorithm
 - Low memory requirement
 - Good *perceptual* quality (and not best SNR)
 .
 Warning: This resampler is relatively new. Although I think I got rid of
 all the major bugs and I don't expect the API to change anymore, there
 may be something I've missed. So use with caution.
 .
 This algorithm is based on this original resampling algorithm:
 Smith, Julius O. Digital Audio Resampling Home Page
 Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA),
 Stanford University, 2007.
 Web published at https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/resample/.
 .
 There is one main difference, though. This resampler uses cubic
 interpolation instead of linear interpolation in the above paper. This
 makes the table much smaller and makes it possible to compute that table
 on a per-stream basis. In turn, being able to tweak the table for each
 stream makes it possible to both reduce complexity on simple ratios
 (e.g. 2/3), and get rid of the rounding operations in the inner loop.
 The latter both reduces CPU time and makes the algorithm more SIMD-friendly.

 The echo canceller is based on the MDF algorithm described in:
 .
 J. S. Soo, K. K. Pang Multidelay block frequency adaptive filter,
 IEEE Trans. Acoust. Speech Signal Process., Vol. ASSP-38, No. 2,
 February 1990.
 .
 We use the Alternatively Updated MDF (AUMDF) variant. Robustness to
 double-talk is achieved using a variable learning rate as described in:
 .
 Valin, J.-M., On Adjusting the Learning Rate in Frequency Domain Echo
 Cancellation With Double-Talk. IEEE Transactions on Audio,
 Speech and Language Processing, Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 1030-1034, 2007.

 This script attempts to guess a canonical system name similar to
 config.sub.  If it succeeds, it prints the system name on stdout, and
 exits with 0.  Otherwise, it exits with 1.

# License file: COPYING
 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 Version 3, 29 June 2007
 .
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.
 .
 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
    the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
    software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
    GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
    any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
 .
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
    To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
    these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
    certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
    you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
 .
    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
    freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
    know their rights.
 .
    Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
    giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
 .
    For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
    that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
    authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
    changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
    authors of previous versions.
 .
    Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
    modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
    can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
    protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
    pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
    use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
    have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
    products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
    stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
    of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
 .
    Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
    States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
    software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
    avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
    make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
    patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
 .
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
 .
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
    0. Definitions.
 .
    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
    works, such as semiconductor masks.
 .
    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 .
    To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 .
    A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.
 .
    To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
    To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
    An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
   to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
   tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
       extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
   work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
   the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
   menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
   1. Source Code.
 .
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work.
 .
   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
   is widely used among developers working in that language.
 .
   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
   Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
   Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
   implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
   "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
   (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
   (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
   produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
   the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
       work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
   control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
   System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
   programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
   which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
   includes interface definition files associated with source files for
   the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
   subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
   can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
   Source.
 .
   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
   same work.
 .
   2. Basic Permissions.
 .
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 .
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
   convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
   in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
   of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
   with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
   the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
   not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
   for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
   and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
   your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
   the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
   makes it unnecessary.
 .
   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 .
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
   similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
   measures.
 .
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
   is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
   the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
   modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
   users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
   technological measures.
 .
   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 .
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
   and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 .
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
   terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
   it, and giving a relevant date.
 .
   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
   released under this License and any conditions added under section
   7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
   "keep intact all notices".
 .
   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
   License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
   License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
   additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
   regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
   permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
   invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
   Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
   interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
   work need not make them do so.
 .
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
   works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
   and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
   in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
   "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
   used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
   beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
   in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
   parts of the aggregate.
 .
   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 .
   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
   of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
   machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
   in one of these ways:
 .
   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
   Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
   customarily used for software interchange.
 .
   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
   (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
   written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
   long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
   model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
   copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
   product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
   medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
   more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
   conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
   Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
   written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
   alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
   only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
   with subsection 6b.
 .
   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
   place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
   Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
   further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
   Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
   copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
 may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
   that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
   clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
   Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
   Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
   available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
   you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
   Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
   charge under subsection 6d.
 .
   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
   from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
   included in conveying the object code work.
 .
   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
   or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
   into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
   doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
   product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
   typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
   of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
   actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
   is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
   commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
   the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
   procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
   and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
   a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
   suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
   code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
   modification has been made.
 .
   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
   part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
   User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
   fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
   Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
   by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
   if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
   modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
       been installed in ROM).
 .
   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
   for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
   the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
   network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
   adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
   protocols for communication across the network.
 .
   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
   in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
   documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
       source code form), and must require no special password or key for
   unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
   7. Additional Terms.
 .
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
   that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
   this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
   remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
   it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
       removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
   additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
   for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
   add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
       that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
   terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
   author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
   Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 .
   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
   requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
   reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 .
   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
   authors of the material; or
 .
   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
   trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
   material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
       it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
   any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
   those licensors and authors.
 .
   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
   governed by this License along with a term that is a further
   restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
   a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
   License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
   of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
   not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
   must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
   additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
   where to find the applicable terms.
 .
   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
   form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
   the above requirements apply either way.
 .
   8. Termination.
 .
   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
   provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
       paragraph of section 11).
 .
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
   provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
   finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
   holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
   prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
   reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
   violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
   received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
   copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
   your receipt of the notice.
 .
   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
   this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
   material under section 10.
 .
   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
   run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
   to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
   nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
   modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
   not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
   covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 .
   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
   propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
   work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
   transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
   licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
   give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
   Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
   the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 .
   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
   rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
   not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
   rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
   sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 .
   11. Patents.
 .
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
   work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 .
   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
   owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
   hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
   by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
   but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
   consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
   purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
   patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
   this License.
 .
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
   propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 .
   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
    sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
   party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
   patent against the party.
 .
   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
   and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
   to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
   publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
   then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
   patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
   consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
   license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
   actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
   covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
   in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
   country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
   arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
   covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
   receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
   or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
   you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
   work and works based on it.
 .
   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
   the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
   conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
   specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
   work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
   in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
   to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
   the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
   parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
   patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
   conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
   for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
   contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
   or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 .
   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
   any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
   otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 .
   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 .
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
   the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
   License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
   under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
   combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
   License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
   but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
   section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
   combination as such.
 .
   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.
 .
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
   Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
   Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
   option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
   version or of any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
   GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
   by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
   versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
   public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
   to choose that version for the Program.
 .
   Later license versions may give you additional or different
   permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
   author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
   later version.
 .
   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
   OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
   THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
   IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
   ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. Limitation of Liability.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
   THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
   USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
       DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
       PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 .
   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
   above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
   reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
   an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
   Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
   copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
   to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
   state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
   the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
   <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
   Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
   This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
   the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
   (at your option) any later version.
 .
   This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
   but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
   MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
   GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
   You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
   along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
   notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
   <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
   This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
   This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
   under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
   parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
   might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
 .
   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
   if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
   For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
   <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
   into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
   may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
   the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
   Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
   <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
