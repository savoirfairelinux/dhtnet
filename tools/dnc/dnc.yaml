# The bootstrap node serves as the entry point to the DHT network.
# By default, bootstrap.sfl.io is configured for the public DHT network and should be used for personal use only.
# For production environments, it is recommended to set up your own bootstrap node to establish your own DHT network.

# TURN server is used as a fallback for connections if the NAT block all possible connections.
# By default is turn.sfl.io (which uses coturn) but can be any TURN.
# Developer must set up their own TURN server before going to production, as this one will not scale.
