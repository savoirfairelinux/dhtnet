# Packaging and release

In `extras/packaging`, the `build_packages.sh` script will build packages for supported platforms. The OS argument must be provided. The platform architecture (arm64, x86, â€¦) is unable to be specified as packages will only be compiled and built on the platform that the build runs on.

**Usage:**
```bash
extras/packaging/build_packages.sh -a  # -a or --all builds all supported platforms
extras/packaging/build_packages.sh -u  # -u or --ubuntu builds all supported versions of Ubuntu
extras/packaging/build_packages.sh -u22 -d11  # -u22 builds ubuntu 22.04 and -d11 builds Debian 11
```
